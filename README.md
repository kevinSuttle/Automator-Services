# OSX Automator Services
Automator is a hidden gem.

This is just a collection of useful Automator services I've been using here and there. I finally decided to put this on GitHub, in case others would find it useful. 

*Side note: Did you know you can also use Automator in the terminal?* `‚ùØ automator`


## DISCLAIMER

These services are not thoroughly tested and are highly inflexible. 
By using them, you should understand that they may really mess your stuff up. Like badly. 
You've been warned. 


Other than that though, have fun, fork, and add your own!
